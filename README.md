### Rules of the Game

A set of rules and a basic description of what the game offers.

* The game is a simple game built for the PC with additional MAkey-Makey inputs during our Round 4 in the BVW class.
* The prompt for the assignment was to build an experience for the guests with a deep and engaging story in mind.
* The story in the game was that you were a getaway driver for a heist that was being conducted by the gingerbread people in Candyland to steal Chocochips.
* The guests goal was to drive a car prop that we made. The car prop had a rotary encoder and a makey-makey that gave us additional input.
